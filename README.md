TASHY2 is short from Tcl Ada SHell Younger version 2. It is derivate of
[TASHY](https://github.com/thindil/tashy)

**IMPORTANT:** TASHY2 is not compatible with TASHY. At this moment it is at
very early stage of the development, pre-alpha stage. Also, this is now
mostly a playground thus don't expect too much soon :) If you read this
file on Github: **please don't send pull requests here**.
